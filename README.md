# Hexcellent

I went looking for a (graphical) hex editor on Linux. After trying several (GHex, Bless, Okteta, wxHexEditor), I was disappointed to find not a single one that didn't have at least one of the following issues:

* Requires an existing file to edit
* Copy and paste limited to the text side
* Copy and paste limited to the hex side
* Copy and paste on the hex side picky about whitespace
* Copy and paste completely broken
* Saving completely broken

I had had enough of everything I tried not getting the basics right and decided to do what I always do in these situations: write my own. I had in fact already written one years ago, inspired by an old Macintosh program called HexEdit, as part of a project called Resplendence. So I took a look at my decade-old code, said "what a mess," started over, and rewrote it as a standalone application.

Be hexcellent to each other.
